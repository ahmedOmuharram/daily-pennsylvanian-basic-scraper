```
User-agent: *
Crawl-delay: 10
Allow: /

User-agent: SemrushBot
Disallow: /
```

## Explanation
### Global Directives (`User-agent: *`)
- **Crawl-delay: 10:**  
  Instructs all web crawlers to wait 10 seconds between requests, helping to reduce the server load.
  
- **Allow: /**  
  Permits crawlers to access every part of the website, ensuring full indexation of the content.

### Specific Directive for SemrushBot
- **User-agent: SemrushBot:**  
  Targets the SEO tool SemrushBot specifically.
  
- **Disallow:**  
  The `Disallow: /` rule means that SemrushBot is completely blocked from crawling any part of the website. This strict directive prevents the bot from accessing any pages, which might be intended to prevent data scraping or to reduce load from that specific crawler.

### Overall Implications
- **For General Crawlers:**  
  The website is completely accessible, but crawlers are requested to space out their requests (one every 10 seconds) to protect server performance.
  
- **For SemrushBot:**  
  It is entirely blocked from crawling the site, ensuring that it does not contribute to the server load or index the site content.
